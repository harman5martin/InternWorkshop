public class RatedPlayerIterator {

    // TODO Exercise 1

    // Create a custom iterator that encapsulates a list of players
    // and iterates through it based on the player's rating.
    // In this case, the iterator should only return players with
    // a 4 star rating or higher.

    // After you complete the iterator, create a main class in the package
    // titled "IteratorExample" that uses this iterator and prints out
    // to the console the players information like the output of BasicIterator.

    // If working correctly, you should only see players printed that have 4 or 5 stars.

    // Feel free to ask any questions that arise during the exercise and be ready to share
    // your implementation with the group when we reconvene after the exercise
