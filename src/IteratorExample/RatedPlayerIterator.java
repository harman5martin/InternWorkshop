// TODO Exercise 1

// Create a custom iterator that encapsulates a list of players
// and iterates through it based on the player's rating.
// In this case, the iterator should only return players with
// a 4 star rating or higher. This implementation does NOT need a
// remove method.

// After you complete the iterator, create a main class in the package
// titled "IteratorExample" that uses this iterator and prints out
// to the console the players information like the output of BasicIterator.
