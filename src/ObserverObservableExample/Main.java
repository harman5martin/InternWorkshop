        // Example of creating a game
        // new Game(<sport>, <team1>, <team2>
        // new Game("Basketball", "Duke", "UNC");
    }

    // Scanner directions and example
    // When typing into the console information about the games and score, do so in
    // the following format: 1) game index for the game you want (int), 2) the team
    // that scored (string) (MUST match the exact string of the team when you create the game),
    // 3) amount of points scored at that instance (int).
    // Note: There MUST be a space in between each of the 3 inputs when entering them into
    // the console. Also, pressing enter in between each one is fine too.
    // Example1: 0 UNC 3
    // Example2: 1
    //           DUKE
    //           2
