TODO Exercise 2

I have provided you with 2 interfaces to get started that represent the observable and the
observer. You need to make implementations of both interfaces. Your group can pick a favorite
team to use for the observer (mine is UNC). You can have multiple sports games playing with your
favorite team.

When your favorite team scores, you want to cheer for them. You can simply do this by printing
to the console cheers for your team. If your favorite team scores and they are winning, then
say "GO <TEAM>!". If your favorite team scores but they are losing, then say "Good job <TEAM>,
keep playing hard.". If your team isn't the one to score, then say "Stay tough <TEAM>.".

You can make this exercise more interactive by creating a main class after implementing the two
interfaces that creates and stores an array of games. I have already created this main class for
you in this package and it has a little bit of code and comments to get you started.
You should use the built in scanner to allow users to type into the console a numerical index
in the game array representing a single game, the team who scored, and then how many points
were scored. After this happens each time, print the score of that game to the console.

Feel free to ask any questions that arise during the exercise and be ready to share
your implementation with the group when we reconvene after the exercise.

Note: I have my own solution to this exercise in another repository that will be shared
to everyone after each group is provided time to work on this exercise.
